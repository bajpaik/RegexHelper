1.  How to enable automatic user creation from email?
Answer : Set the property "glide.pop3readerjob.create_caller" to true in system properties, this will automatically create users for incoming emails from trusted domains.

2. How to allow locked-out users to trigger inbound email actions?
Answer: By adding the system property "glide.pop3.process_locked_out" to true.
Note : Note that inbound emails from inactive users will not be processed.

3. How to hide watermark globally?
Answer: Navigate to sys_properties table and set property "glide.email.watermark.visible" and set it to false.

4.To change the default behavior, increase the value of the sn_flow_designer.max_actions system property.

5. Want to pass data from widget to other application on a portal page like virtual agent?

spContextManager API makes it easy.

Method: addContext (Initializes a key and adds widget data as the value)

addContext(String key, Object context)

Example:
function ($scope, spContextManager) {
  spContextManager.addContext('agent-chat', {
    'approval_count': 5    
  });
};

if key is already defined use updateContextForKey method instead to update context.

6. Want to scroll to a particular widget on a portal page on click of link or button?

spUtil is your go to API.

spUtil.scrollTo(String selector, Number time);

String Selector = The selector to scroll to.
Number time = The time, in milliseconds, taken to scroll to the specified selector.

HTML :
<button ng-click="goTo()" > Go to</button>

Client Controller:

$scope.goTo= function()
{
spUtil.scrollTo('.sp-scroll', 300);
}

7. Sometimes to make something work we need to clear the cache.
To clear the cache you can use the following:
In background script type gs.cacheFlush() and run it. But it is not recommended to do it in Prod instance as it will cause performance issues.
But if you want to clear the cache in Prod, what you can do is pass some parameter to gs.cacheFlush() e.g. gs.cacheFlush('syscache_ui_policy') it will not have much impact on the performance as it will target only the specific area.
