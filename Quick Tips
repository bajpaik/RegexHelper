5. Want to pass data from widget to other application on a portal page like virtual agent?

spContextManager API makes it easy.

Method: addContext (Initializes a key and adds widget data as the value)

addContext(String key, Object context)

Example:
function ($scope, spContextManager) {
  spContextManager.addContext('agent-chat', {
    'approval_count': 5    
  });
};

if key is already defined use updateContextForKey method instead to update context.

6. Want to scroll to a particular widget on a portal page on click of link or button?

spUtil is your go to API.

spUtil.scrollTo(String selector, Number time);

String Selector = The selector to scroll to.
Number time = The time, in milliseconds, taken to scroll to the specified selector.

HTML :
<button ng-click="goTo()" > Go to</button>

Client Controller:

$scope.goTo= function()
{
spUtil.scrollTo('.sp-scroll', 300);
}

7. Sometimes to make something work we need to clear the cache.
To clear the cache you can use the following:
In background script type gs.cacheFlush() and run it. But it is not recommended to do it in Prod instance as it will cause performance issues.
But if you want to clear the cache in Prod, what you can do is pass some parameter to gs.cacheFlush() e.g. gs.cacheFlush('syscache_ui_policy') it will not have much impact on the performance as it will target only the specific area.
